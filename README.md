# Phobos/3arthh4ck 1.3.1 BUILDABLE-SRC

Not a reconstructed src this time, rather the real one.
Released by ohare, but contained errors. I have fixed these errors and this src is now fully buildable (make issue if you have errors)

Windows: setupdecompworkspace, gradlew build

Macos/Linux: ./setupdecompworkspace, ./gradlew build

I can confirm this SRC and release are clean

[Clean jar](https://github.com/Gopro336/clean-3arthh4ck-1.3.1/releases/tag/clean)(Older version use prebuilt in releases for latest)
